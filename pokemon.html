     Pokémon (ポケモン Pokemon?), abbreviated from the Japanese title of Pocket Monsters (ポケットモンスター Poketto Monsutā), is a long running Japanese children's cartoon television series, which has been adapted for the international television markets. It is based on the Pokémon video game series and is a part of the franchise.

The Pokémon cartoon is split up into five chronologically sequential series in Japan, split up by the version of the video game series the anime takes inspiration from: the original series, the Advanced Generation series, the Diamond & Pearl series, the Best Wishes! series, and currently the XY series which began in October 2013. In the international broadcasts, these five series are split into 18 separate seasons.

These cartoon series are accompanied by spin-off programming, consisting of Pokémon Chronicles, a series of side stories featuring characters in the anime that are not its current cast of main characters, and the live action variety and Pokémon-related news shows of Weekly Pokémon Broadcasting Station, Pokémon Sunday, Pokémon Smash!, and Pokémon Get TV, premiering in late 2013.
